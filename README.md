# Digital Logic Simulations Via OOP

This project simulates fundamental digital logic components using object oriented programming principles.
It includes implementation of logic gates, a half adder and a full adder constructed via gate composition.

## Features 
- Object-oriented base class for logic gates
- Implementations of AND, OR, NOT and XOR gates
- Half Adder and Full Adder built from logic gate components
- Console-based testing for validation

## Concepts 
- Object Oriented Programming
- Boolean logic and digital circuit fundamentals
- Modular and extensible design
- Hardware abstraction through software modeling
